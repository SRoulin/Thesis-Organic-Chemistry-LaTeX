# Thesis-Organic-Chemistry-LaTeX

This is the template I modified for my PhD thesis. It does everything natively including organic molecule structures, compound numbering and referencing.

- The package uses mchem and chemfig to write chemical equations, draw organic structures and to follow compounds with compound numbers.

- Use LuaLaTeX to generate the pdf output.
