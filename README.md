# Thesis-Organic-Chemistry-LaTeX

This is the template I modified for my PhD thesis. It does everything natively including organic molecule structures, compound numbering and referencing.

- The package uses mchem and chemfig to write chemical equations, draw organic structures and to follow compounds with compound numbers.

- Use LuaLaTeX to generate the pdf output.

- Checkout the [LaTeX/Chapters/Example.tex][Example] to see how to add schemes, drawings and reference in text.

- Change variables in the Thesis.cls file and comment out the example files.

- There are also Experimental templates which make compound entries look rather nice with copy and paste assignments for NMR spectra.

Please let me know if you have any issues.
